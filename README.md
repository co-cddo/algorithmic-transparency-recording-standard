# Algorithmic Transparency Standard (ATS)

This repository contains all the work on the Algorithmic Transparency Standard by the [Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office) and the [Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/centre-for-data-ethics-and-innovation).

The ATS was developed to help public sector organisations provide clear information about the algorithmic tools they use in decision-making processes that affect members of the public, and explain why they’re using them. It enables public bodies to proactively publish this information in a standardised way on gov.uk and make it accessible to members of the public. The ATS is a reporting standard that introduces a standardised way of presenting and communicating predominantly qualitative information about how technologies are being used in decision processes.

The first version (v1.1) of the ATS was [published on gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/algorithmic-transparency-standard) in November 2021. After an extensive phase of piloting the Standard with public sector teams and collecting feedback, we have updated the Standard and developed accompanying guidance that is intended to help teams fill out transparency reports for their tools. 

The current version of the ATS published here on GitHub is v1.2. Additionally, this repository contains a change log of the changes made to the standard, a guidance document, and a maintenance plan for the standard. 

We are seeking renewed feedback on the updated Algorithmic Transparency Standard and accompanying guidance. Everyone is invited to give feedback on the updates through creating a new ‘Issue’. We will then review and evaluate new feedback before publishing the updated version of the Standard (v2.1) on gov.uk.
